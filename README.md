So far, the table will appear with products that are available to purchase. You can choose which item ID you want, as well as how many you want. If you choose an item ID that's not in the table, you'll receive an error. You also won't be able to purchase anything if the amount of units you want to purchase exceeds the stock quantity.

<h3>Commentary</h3>
I've provided screenshots of how it functions so far. I intend on updating this to have the total price listed. A bug that was pointed out is my products never reset back to the original setting, even when I exit out and restart my app. I doubt the issue is tied to using the same port... it may be because I never stop my server. I wonder if the same bug will occur if someone else tests my app. Looking forward to hearing TA feedback.
