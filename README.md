So far, the table will appear of products. You can choose which item ID you want, as well as how many you want. If you choose an item ID that's not in the table, you'll receive an error.

<h3>Components</h3>
JavaScript | MySql

<h3>Packages Needed</h3>
Inquirer | Console Table (optional) | Chalk (optional) | MySql | Node.js

<h3>Commentary</h3>
I've provided screenshots of how it functions so far. Still need to work on the last function to make sure the table updates properly and transactions can occur.
